                answer_explanation: ` 
                    The conversation reveals that Claudia is frustrated with her philosophy class because her group members are not contributing effectively to their midterm project. This supports option (A).

                    ❌ Option B is incorrect because the engineering class project was Miguel’s past experience, not Claudia’s concern.
                    ❌ Option C is incorrect because Claudia's issue was with her group’s work, not her own understanding of Aristotle.
                    ❌ Option D is incorrect because there is no mention of Claudia receiving a poor grade.

                    Thus, option (A) is the best answer.

                answer_explanation: ` 
                    ✔️ Option A is correct because Claudia mentions that her group project requires writing a 10-page paper as part of the assignment.  
                    ✔️ Option C is correct because Claudia states that they must also prepare a 20-minute presentation about notable philosophers.  
                    ❌ Option B is incorrect because the paper is 10 pages, not 20.  
                    ❌ Option D is incorrect because the presentation is 20 minutes, not 10.  

                    Thus, the correct answers are (A) and (C).

                    "Communicating",
                    "Correcting",

                answer_explanation: `
                    ✔️ Option D is correct because "commiserating" means expressing sympathy or sharing in someone’s distress, which aligns with "Sympathizing."

                    ❌ Option A is incorrect because "Communicating" refers to exchanging information, not necessarily expressing sympathy.  
                    ❌ Option B is incorrect because "Correcting" means making something right, not sharing in someone's feelings.  
                    ❌ Option C is incorrect because "Agreeing" means having the same opinion, which does not fully capture the idea of expressing sympathy.  

                    Thus, the correct answer is (D).

                    "Because one student did a poor job covering his material",

                answer_explanation: `
                    ✔️ Option B is correct because Claudia complains that one group member did a poor job covering his material, failing to meet the assignment requirements.  

                    ✔️ Option C is correct because Claudia states that two of her group members have not yet started their sections of the project.  

                    ❌ Option A is incorrect because there is no mention that a student’s dislike for philosophy is the reason for their poor contribution.  
                    ❌ Option D is incorrect because the project counts for 40% of their grade, so the group members know it is important.

                answer_explanation: `
                    ✔️ Option C is correct because the male student explains that he had to do most of the group work on his own, meaning he "carried the weight" of the project.  

                    ❌ Option A is incorrect because the phrase is metaphorical and not about the bridge design itself.  
                    ❌ Option B is incorrect because he did not mention assigning roles, only that others did not contribute.  
                    ❌ Option D is incorrect because there is no mention of physically testing the bridge’s weight capacity.  

                    Thus, the correct answer is (C).

                answer_explanation: `
                    ✔️ Option A is correct because the female student explicitly states that she used to love group projects, but due to her current bad experience, she no longer enjoys them.  

                    ❌ Option B is incorrect because she is now frustrated with group projects, not enjoying them.  
                    ❌ Option C is incorrect because her opinion changed due to the project experience, not because of studying philosophers.  
                    ❌ Option D is incorrect because she never mentions disliking philosophy class before the project.  

                    Thus, the correct answer is (A).

                    ✔️ Option B is correct because the lecture focuses on how SPD manifests differently in individuals.

                    ✔️ Option B is correct because the professor explains that sensory integration issues arise due to the interrelation of senses.
                    ❌ Option A is incorrect because OT is a treatment, not a cause of integration issues.
                    ❌ Option C is incorrect because not all individuals with SPD are both seekers and defensive.
                    ❌ Option D is incorrect because the name change does not explain sensory integration issues.

              answer_explanation: `
                ✔️ Options B and D are correct because early anthropological work was often speculative, biased, and lacked rigorous evidence collection.

              answer_explanation: `
                ✔️ Options C and D are correct. Boas’s liberal upbringing allowed him to question traditional beliefs, and his scientific background ensured rigorous methodology in anthropology.
                ❌ Option A is incorrect because religious influence wasn’t a factor.
                ❌ Option B is too simplistic and not mentioned as a core influence on his anthropological work.

              answer_explanation: `
                ✔️ Option B is correct because both Darwin and Boas emphasized adaptation to local environments rather than following a fixed, linear path.
                ❌ Option A is incorrect because Darwin did not directly inspire Boas’s anthropological focus.
                ❌ Option C is incorrect as Boas studied societies; Darwin studied natural species.

                ✔️ Option D is correct because Boas criticized the evolutionary order of displays that suggested a hierarchy of cultures.
                ❌ Option A is incorrect because Boas didn’t question the artefacts themselves.
                ❌ Option B is incorrect because all cultures were represented—just in a biased way.

                ✔️ Option D is correct because Boas demonstrated that cranial shape and size are influenced by environmental factors like nutrition, not race.
                ❌ Option A is too general and not the exact point Boas made.
                ❌ Option B is incorrect because injuries were not part of his study.

                ✔️ Option B is correct because Boas’s approach included language, evolution, archaeology, and cultural practices—broadening the scope of anthropology.
                ❌ Option A is incorrect—Boas emphasized immersion and learning the language.
                ❌ Option C is incorrect as he discouraged distant observation.
