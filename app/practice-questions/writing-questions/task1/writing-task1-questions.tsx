            The development of online education has brought transformative changes to the educational landscape. Advocates of online education highlight its flexibility, affordability, and accessibility. For instance, students can study from any location, reducing the need for physical infrastructure and commuting expenses. Online platforms provide vast resources such as recorded lectures, digital libraries, and discussion forums, enabling learners to access high-quality materials at any time. Additionally, many online courses are more cost-effective than traditional classroom-based education, as they eliminate costs related to campus facilities, accommodation, and transportation.
            Another significant advantage of online education is personalized learning. Students can set their own pace, revisit lectures, and focus on areas where they struggle, which is often not possible in a traditional classroom setting. Moreover, online education has allowed students from underprivileged regions to gain access to world-class programs and educators, bridging educational gaps globally.
            However, critics argue that online education has notable limitations. They point out that the absence of face-to-face interaction reduces opportunities for developing soft skills such as teamwork and communication. Many students report feeling isolated and unmotivated without the structure of a physical classroom. Furthermore, while flexibility is a major selling point, it can lead to procrastination and low productivity among students who lack self-discipline. Finally, skeptics question the effectiveness of online learning in fields that require hands-on training, such as medicine or engineering, where practical experience is essential.

            Like many creatures, humpback whales migrate long distances for feeding and mating purposes. How animals manage to migrate long distances is often puzzling. In the case of humpback whales, we may have found the answer: they may be navigating by the stars, much as early human sailors did. What we know about humpback whales makes this a distinct possibility.
            First, humpback whales seem to be intelligent enough to use stars to navigate by. Whales’ brains have a high degree of complexity—a common determiner of intelligence. This suggests that the whales’ brain power far exceeds that of most other animals. The whales’ well-developed cognitive ability seems to provide a sound basis for the ability to use a complex, abstract system of sensory stimuli such as the night sky for orientation.
            Second, humpback whales migrate in straight lines. Animals can maintain movement in a straight direction for long distances only if they orient themselves by some external objects or forces. Many birds and other terrestrial creatures, for example, use physical landmarks to help them stay on track as they migrate. Whales, which swim in the open ocean, cannot rely on land features; they could, however, rely on stars at night to provide them with external signs by which to maintain direction over long distances.
            Third, humpback whales exhibit an unusual behavior: they are sometimes observed floating straight up for minutes at a time, their heads above the water as though they were looking upward. The behavior is known as spy-hopping, and it is very rare among marine animals. One explanation for the function of spy-hopping is that the whales are looking at the stars, which are providing them with information to navigate by.

            A recent study reveals that people, especially young people, are reading far less literature—novels, plays, and poems—than they used to. This is troubling because the trend has unfortunate effects for the reading public, for culture in general, and for the future of literature itself.
            While there has been a decline in book reading generally, the decline has been especially sharp for literature. This is unfortunate because nothing else provides the intellectual stimulation that literature does. Literature encourages us to exercise our imaginations, empathize with others, and expand our understanding of language. So by reading less literature, the reading public is missing out on important benefits.
            Unfortunately, missing out on the benefits of literature is not the only problem. What are people reading instead? Consider the prevalence of self-help books on lists of best sellers. These are usually superficial, poorly written, and intellectually undemanding. Additionally, instead of sitting down with a challenging novel, many persons are now more likely to turn on the television, watch a music video, or read a Web page. Clearly, diverting time previously spent in reading literature to trivial forms of entertainment has lowered the level of culture in general.
            The trend of reading less literature is all the more regrettable because it is taking place during a period when good literature is being written. There are many talented writers today, but they lack an audience. This fact is bound to lead publishers to invest less in literature and so support fewer serious writers. Thus, the writing as well as the reading of literature is likely to decline because of the poor standards of today’s readers.
