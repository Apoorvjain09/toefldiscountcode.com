        passage: `University administrators announced yesterday that the sculpture program, a division of the art department, will be eliminated. “The main reason is a lack of student interest,” reported one administrator. “Although the number of art students has increased, fewer and fewer art majors are taking sculpture classes.” Furthermore, the department’s only sculpture professor is retiring this year. “Given the art department’s limited budget,” the administrator explained, “it just doesn’t make sense to hire a new full-time professor to teach sculpture for only a handful of students.”`,

        question: "Summarize the points made in the lecture you just heard, explaining how they cast doubt on the contents of the reading. You may refer to the passage as you write.",
        passage: `
            Wilderness management has advanced greatly over the last century, due in part to such practices as the suppression of forest fires and limitations on the clearcutting of trees. Monitoring forests for small brushfires is easier with aircraft; as is the use of large amounts of water and sophisticated chemical fire extinguishers to prevent fires from spreading.
            The goals of decreasing the amount of destruction by fires and cutting are wide-ranging. One is simply the longer lives and improved health of trees. In some areas of hickory and oak forest on the Eastern Seaboard, fire suppression has allowed the maturation of so many trees that the treetops form a continuous canopy.
            There is evidence of the healthful effects of fire suppression closer to the ground as well. Vines and low bushes that would be burned out in a forest fire can flourish when fires are suppressed, of course, but there is a more indirect way fires harm plant life. Chemical tests on areas that have recently experienced forest fires demonstrate that burning decreases the overall amount of nutrients in the soil. Suppressing fires prevents such m a decrease. Ferns, wildflowers, and herbs grow without disturbance.
            Finally, wildlife can benefit. In the eastern hickory and oak forests, the suppression of fires has meant that forest animals—ranging from small insects and birds to large deer and bears—are not burned to death. Deer populations, in particular, have increased notably.

        passage: "Plate tectonics assumes that the Earth's rigid outer layer is comprised of a number of slabs called plates, which are constantly in motion, changing the position of land masses and seascapes relative to each other throughout history. The plates move slowly but continuously at about the rate of 2 inches every year. The movement of the plates themselves may be caused by the unequal distribution of heat and pressure below them. Very hot material deep within the mantle, that is, the layer of rock inside the Earth, moves upward while the cooler layer descends into the mantle, putting the outer crust of the continents in motion. Several large plates include an entire continent with its surrounding seafloor; however, the boundaries of the plates do not correspond precisely with the seven continents that we recognize today.",

When an individual learns through experience that a certain behavior results in pleasant consequences, that behavior is likely to be repeated.

        question: "Explain the correlation between the behavior of horses and antelope in herds and their suitability for domestication, as described by the professor.",
        passage: `
            For hundreds of years, humans have possessed the ability to domesticate numerous large mammals found in the wild, particularly those that naturally gather in herds. Once subjected to domestication, these mammals serve various purposes such as aiding in agricultural tasks and facilitating transportation. However, the domestication process is not equally successful for all herd mammals.
            A key determinant of an animal's suitability for domestication lies in its territorial behavior. Non-territorial animals prove to be more amenable to domestication compared to their territorial counterparts, primarily because they can coexist harmoniously with individuals from other herds. Additionally, the presence of a hierarchical social structure within a herd significantly influences the ease of domestication. Animals that exhibit such hierarchical dynamics, where members follow a leader, are more readily domesticated, as humans can effectively assume the role of the leader in guiding and managing them.

            The university has opted to implement an approximately 8% tuition and fee hike for all students in the upcoming semester. While tuition and fees have remained unchanged for the past five years, the decision to increase them is now deemed necessary due to several factors. Firstly, the university has experienced a significant increase in student enrollment over the past five years, necessitating the hiring of additional professors to accommodate the growing student population. Additionally, the institution has made a fresh commitment to research and technology, prompting plans to renovate and enhance laboratory facilities to better cater to the needs of students.

        passage: `
            Prey animals employ a variety of methods, including running and hiding, to avoid being caught by predators. Yet some animals do not hide but instead stand out. This is often accomplished through the method known as warning coloration. Animals utilizing warning coloration have brightly colored fur or skin. They are typically blue, purple, white, orange, red, or yellow in color. Many of these animals have lethal poison or venom. Predators that see brightly colored animals almost always avoid them. That is particularly true if the predators have had prior negative experiences with similar-looking animals.
