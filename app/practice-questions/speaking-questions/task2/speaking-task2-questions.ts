        question: "The woman expresses her opinion of the university’s plan. State her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.",
        passage: `University administrators announced yesterday that the sculpture program, a division of the art department, will be eliminated. “The main reason is a lack of student interest,” reported one administrator. “Although the number of art students has increased, fewer and fewer art majors are taking sculpture classes.” Furthermore, the department’s only sculpture professor is retiring this year. “Given the art department’s limited budget,” the administrator explained, “it just doesn’t make sense to hire a new full-time professor to teach sculpture for only a handful of students.”`,

        question: "Summarize the points made in the lecture you just heard, explaining how they cast doubt on the contents of the reading. You may refer to the passage as you write.",
        passage: `
            Wilderness management has advanced greatly over the last century, due in part to such practices as the suppression of forest fires and limitations on the clearcutting of trees. Monitoring forests for small brushfires is easier with aircraft; as is the use of large amounts of water and sophisticated chemical fire extinguishers to prevent fires from spreading.
            The goals of decreasing the amount of destruction by fires and cutting are wide-ranging. One is simply the longer lives and improved health of trees. In some areas of hickory and oak forest on the Eastern Seaboard, fire suppression has allowed the maturation of so many trees that the treetops form a continuous canopy.
            There is evidence of the healthful effects of fire suppression closer to the ground as well. Vines and low bushes that would be burned out in a forest fire can flourish when fires are suppressed, of course, but there is a more indirect way fires harm plant life. Chemical tests on areas that have recently experienced forest fires demonstrate that burning decreases the overall amount of nutrients in the soil. Suppressing fires prevents such m a decrease. Ferns, wildflowers, and herbs grow without disturbance.
            Finally, wildlife can benefit. In the eastern hickory and oak forests, the suppression of fires has meant that forest animals—ranging from small insects and birds to large deer and bears—are not burned to death. Deer populations, in particular, have increased notably.

        question: "The man expresses his opinion of the new meal plan. Report his opinion, and explain the reasons that he gives for having that opinion.",
        passage: "Residence hall students are no longer required to purchase seven-day meal plans. Now two meal plan options will be offered. The traditional seven-day plan will still be available, including three meals every day at a cost of $168 per month. In addition, a five-day plan will be offered, including three meals Monday-Friday at a cost of $120 per month. Students who elect to use the five-day plan may purchase meals on the weekend at three dollars per meal. The food court in the College Union provides several fast-food alternatives. In addition to burgers and pizza, Chinese food, Mexican food, and a salad bar are also available.",

        passage: "The college will be celebrating the one-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the school by renovating Old Main, the original building. Two alternative plans are being considered. One plan would leave the outer structure intact and concentrate on electrical and plumbing upgrades as well as minor structural support. The other plan would demolish all of the building except the clock tower, which would form the centerpiece of a new structure. An open meeting is scheduled for Friday afternoon at three o'clock in the Old Main auditorium.",

        question: "Explain how plate tectonics relates to the theory of continental drift.",
        passage: "Plate tectonics assumes that the Earth's rigid outer layer is comprised of a number of slabs called plates, which are constantly in motion, changing the position of land masses and seascapes relative to each other throughout history. The plates move slowly but continuously at about the rate of 2 inches every year. The movement of the plates themselves may be caused by the unequal distribution of heat and pressure below them. Very hot material deep within the mantle, that is, the layer of rock inside the Earth, moves upward while the cooler layer descends into the mantle, putting the outer crust of the continents in motion. Several large plates include an entire continent with its surrounding seafloor; however, the boundaries of the plates do not correspond precisely with the seven continents that we recognize today.",

        passage: "You may request an excused absence once per semester without explanation. Just email me and specify the date that you will be absent from class. If you plan to be absent on the day of a test or an exam, however, you must provide an explanation and make arrangements for a makeup test or exam.

        question: "Using the example from the lecture, explain what behavior modification is and how it work.",
        passage: "Individuals often modify their behavior based on what they have learned about the possible consequences of their actions. When an individual learns through experience that a certain behavior results in pleasant consequences, that behavior is likely to be repeated. An unpleasant consequence, on the other hand, discourages further repetition of the behavior. While behavior modification can be observed in experiments, it also occurs frequently in everyday settings, when individuals change their behavior based on what they have learned about the consequences of that behavior.",

        question: "The woman expresses her opinion of the proposed policy change. State her opinion, and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.",
        passage: "Beginning next semester, the University will not allow the use of bicycles on campus. The campus sidewalks are intended for pedestrians and receive heavy pedestrian traffic. Several minor accidents have resulted from people on bicycles colliding with people walking, and although no one has been seriously hurt, University officials feel that bicycles pose a safety risk. Furthermore, the prohibition of bicycles will not be a problem for students, since the university currently operates a convenient alternative: the free campus bus system, which runs between all campus buildings.",
